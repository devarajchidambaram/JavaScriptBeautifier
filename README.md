# JavaScriptBeautifier
Past few months I have working in javascript. So before commit the code Im always beautify the code in online. But i do these tasks repeatly. So am started to automating things which are time consuming. To first step I start write these code to beautify the js code.

Npm need to install 

**sudo npm install js-beautify**

Set the path for files to beautify

**dirName = "/home/ubuntu/dev"**
